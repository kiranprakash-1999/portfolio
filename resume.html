                              <h5>May 2021 - August 2021</h5>
                              <p><em>UBC Molecular Mechatronics Laboratory - Vancouver, BC, Canada </em></p>
                              <p> Designed, prototyped, and manufactured flexible skin-like tactile sensors that determine shear stress, normal stress, and proximity; sensors are used in robotic and flexible electronic application </p>
                              <p>
                                  <b>Mechanical</b>
                                  <ul>
                                      <li>
                                          Designed all jigs required and some automation with SolidWorks to manufacture the sensors, and to characterize their performance.
                                          Many iteration of the jigs were developed during this process to constantly improve on the design.
                                      </li>
                                      <li>
                                          Manufactured custom jig components using FDM/SLA printing (using PLA, ABS, Rigid 10k), maintaining a 0.1mm tolerance for both types.
                                          After tinkering with the printer and slicer settings, was able to achieve a near-SLA appearance to FDM parts.
                                      </li>
                                      <li>
                                          Manufactured and prototyped sensors architecture, each batch of sensors made following a 4-hour process. This process required precise weighing of materials, curing and adhering materials in heat chambers.
                                          Reductively processing material with precise dimensions (~0.3mm tolerance), and manufacturing flexible traces all by hand.
                                      </li>
                                      <li>
                                          Completely overhauled manufacturing methods for flexible sensors and all components. It involved creating a new instructions set, with clear steps and images. Manufacturing speeds were improved by 1 hour, and larger
                                          batches could be produced with new jigs. Moreover, the instructions aimed to remove human interaction with the manufacturing process, to eliminate unnecessary error.
                                      </li>
                                  </ul>

                                  <ul>
                                      <li>Developed circuits to obtain input from sensors, and connect to the control board. Prototyped simple circuits with an STM32 Nucleo platform to check function of the sensors.</li>
                                      <li>
                                          Designed PCBs using Altium to transport signal from sensors to the control board. Due to custom trace technology, this required precise dimensioning and labelling of PCBs,
                                          and appropriate routing to acquire clean signals from the sensors. Many iterations of this were created to utilize multiple/larger sensors, and to optimize space.
                                      </li>
                                      <li>Manufactured rigid and flexible PCBs using small lab equipment. Learned much about photolithography as a result and the limitation of manufacturing PCBs (especially flexible) in a small environment.</li>
                                      <li>Assembled PCBs using multiple methods: heat guns and soldering irons for singular ICs and SMT/thru-hole components, reflow ovens for complete circuits.</li>
                                      <li>Utilized sensor technology to developed new, proprietary, 3D sensor technology.</li>
                                      <li>Designed .dxf files for custom soldermasks and .dxf templates for making propietary flexible trace technology.</li>
                                  </ul>
